# mzTab-L
Standardization of [mzTab-M](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzTab) for Lipidomics within the [LSI](https://www.lipidomics-standards-initiative.org).

## Aims
* To provide best practice reporting guidelines for lipidomics 
* To define and encourage naming and reporting conventions in alignment with established nomenclature systems
* To define requirements and provide examples for reporting of unlabeled, labeled, and general quantitative results

## Example Files
The following files were originally created for mzTab-M, and should serve as a starting point for further additions, refinements and discussion:

* [Description of mzTab-M example files](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzTab/wiki/Examples)

## Semantic Validation / CV rules mapping file
The following files are CV rule mapping files that define where in the mzTab-M document certain CV parameters may occur, which term roots they inherit from and whether CV terms from different vocabularies can be provided as alternatives.
